Place the brush or sponge against the teeth at a 45-degree angle to the surface of the tooth. If using a brush, point the bristles, toward the gumline. Work the toothbrush in a circular motion, covering two or three teeth at a time. Brush all the teeth if possible, but concentrate your attention on the outer surfaces of the upper teeth. Try to spend about 15 seconds on each side of the mouth. When finished, reward your dog with a play session, a special toy, or a dental chew.
