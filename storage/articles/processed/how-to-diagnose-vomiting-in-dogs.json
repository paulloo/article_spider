Because it can have such a wide range of causes, a vomiting dog should be watched closely and taken to a veterinarian if the symptoms are serious.",

If your dog vomits once and is acting normal afterward, you may not need to take them to the vet. However, if the dog is acting differently and/or if the vomiting persists, you may need to go to the vet. If your dog is retching and nothing comes up, or if its stomach looks swollen and bloated, then contact a veterinary surgeon immediately, as this can be a sign of bloat (gastric torsion) which needs immediate attention.

There are different ways to image the abdomen. Radiography is a common diagnostic tool and gives and black and white image. Alternatively, an ultrasound scan may be appropriate. This has the advantage of giving a gray-scale image of the internal structures and can also look inside the organs. If no obvious answer turns up on blood tests and imaging, then it may be necessary to biopsy the area of interest. If a bowel problem is suspected, then open laparotomy to remove a sample of gut to send to a pathologist may be necessary. Bowel biopsies in particular are associated with a high complication rate so your vet will discuss this option with your carefully prior to proceeding.",
